"""Trend decomposition: utilization x unit cost, and adding a mix term.

The standard "how much of the PMPM trend is utilization vs unit cost" exhibit, and
why a third *mix* term matters once your book is a blend of cells. With ``mix_by``
omitted you get the exact two-way identity (frequency x severity). Pass ``mix_by`` and
PMPM is split into within-cell utilization, within-cell unit cost, and the effect of
the membership composition shifting across those cells -- the piece the two-way
otherwise smears into utilization and unit cost. The split uses LMDI, so all three
reconcile exactly to the total, both multiplicatively and in dollars.
